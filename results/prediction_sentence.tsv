29467415	S5	Whereas PARP2 is dispensable for tolerance of cells to SSBs or homologous recombination dysfunction, it is redundant with PARP1 in BER.	PARP2|10038	9|14	PARP1|142	123|128	NoRE

30459351	S5	Using phospho-kinase antibody array to identify signaling through which ANXA1 regulated NPC cell autophagy, we found that ANXA1-suppressed autophagy was associated with PI3K/AKT signaling activation.	ANXA1|301	73|78	ANXA1|301	123|128	NoRE
30459351	S6	We also showed that ANXA1 expression was significantly increased in the NPCs with metastasis relative to NPCs without metastasis and positively correlated with lymphonode and distant metastasis; high ANXA1 expression in the NPC cells promoted in vitro tumor cell migration and invasion and in vivo metastasis.

30459351	S7	Lastly, we showed that inhibition of autophagy restored the ability of tumor cell migration and invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like alterations and in vivo metastasis in the ANXA1 knockdown NPC cells with autophagy activation; ANXA1-suppresed autophagy induced EMT-like alterations possibly by inhibiting autophagy-mediated degradation of Snail.

30459351	S8	Our data suggest that ANXA1-suppressed autophagy promotes NPC cell migration, invasion and metastasis by activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, highlighting that the activation of autophagy may inhibit metastasis of NPC with high ANXA1 expression.	ANXA1|301	23|28	ANXA1|301	231|236	NoRE
